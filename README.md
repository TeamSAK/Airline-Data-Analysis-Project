# Airline Data Analysis Project
Airline Data Analysis Project
Overview
The Airline Data Analysis Project aims to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset related to airline operations. By cleaning, visualizing, and enhancing this dataset with external data from APIs (such as weather information), the project seeks to uncover insights that can benefit the airline industry.

# Project Goal
The primary goals of this project are to:

Clean and preprocess airline data to ensure accuracy and usability.

Integrate real-time data from external sources to enhance analysis.

Identify trends and insights related to flight delays, cancellations, and passenger demographics.

# Benefits to the Industry
This project provides significant value to the airline industry by:

Improving Operational Efficiency: Insights derived from data analysis can help airlines optimize their operations and reduce delays.

Enhancing Decision-Making: Understanding how external factors like weather affect flight schedules can lead to better planning and resource allocation.

Passenger Experience: By analyzing demographics and travel behavior, airlines can tailor services to meet passenger needs, potentially increasing customer satisfaction.

# Python Libraries Used
